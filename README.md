as a way to bring the Shrota language into game development.
just before the equinox of winter entering 2023,
gameslib moves into public view.
Eeshvar Das is now a community contributor in Google's carbon project.

is to maintain gameslib
using the same techniques
that Eeshvar Das
is using in his carbon project fork.
